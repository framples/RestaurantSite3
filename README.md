### Part 2
1. Your header and footer must match across the pages, so store their styles in an external file called restaurantStyles.css.
2. Apply all positioning CSS styles for the image on the home page as an inline style.
3. Apply all styles for the menu and contact form in internal style sheets.
4. Style the restaurant name with a hosted or embedded font.
5. Make sure that the menu item names are larger than their descriptions.
6. Give the menu background a color other than white.
7. Set the background of the home page's content - not including the header, footer, or site navigation - to a color other than white.
8. Set the form labels for the required fields to be bold.
9. Style the site navigation so that:
    9-a. Visited links appear in a different color than their default state.
    9-b. When you hover over a link, the text is bold. This should only be when hovering. Otherwise, the text should be the normal thickness.
    9-c. Active links should not be underlined.
10. Add a section to the menu for beverages, with a table like the one below.
11. Style this table to match your site's look and feel.

    4-a. The menu items should stack well, with no overlapping.
    4-b. The front page content should stack as well.
    4-c. Change the Home link to use an Icon from one of the supported fonts that looks like a house.

    5-c. The Drink of the Month is SG Special Brew.

7. Make sure that users who have JavaScript disabled know that this site is best viewed with JavaScript enabled.
